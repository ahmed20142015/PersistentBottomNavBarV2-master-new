# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [6.0.1] - 2025-05-18
### Fixed
- If no custom NavigatorKeys were specified, state of each tab got lost when reloading.

## [6.0.0] - 2025-05-17
### Added
- Hide the NavBar on scroll: Set `hideOnScrollVelocity` to x (x != 0) to make the NavBar disappear after x pixels have been scrolled (and reappear respectively)
- `SelectedTabPressConfig`, which is responsible for any configuration when the selected tab is pressed again.
  - `SelectedTabPressConfig.popAction` allows to specify how many screens of the current tab should be popped if the tab is pressed again
  - `SelectedTabPressConfig.scrollToTop` enables automatically scrolling the tab content to top if the current tab is pressed again. This requires a ScrollController on each `PersistentTabConfig.scrollController` for each tab this should be activated for.
  - `SelectedTabPressConfig.onPressed` is a callback that gets executed whenever the current tab is pressed again. I also provides an argument whether there are any pages pushed to the tab.
- Navigator function that pop all screens of the current tab: `popAllScreensOfCurrentTab`
- Animated Icons: Animate the navigation bar icons by using the provided `AnimatedIconWrapper` (see README for more)
- PersistentTabController now gives you access to the previousIndex

### Breaking Changes
- Change the default of `navBarOverlap` to `NavBarOverlap.none()` (previously was `NavBarOverlap.full()`)
- Removed ItemConfig.opacity. Instead, set the opacity on the NavBarDecoration.color directly
- Removed ItemConfig.filter. Use NavBarDecoration.filter instead
- Removed default value of NavBarDecoration.filter
- Removed `selectedTabContext`. Use the list of your tabs instead to get the current tab context like so: `tabs[controller.index].navigatorConfig.navigatorKey.currentContext`
- Removed `PersistentTabController.onIndexChanged`. Use `PersistentTabController.listen` instead.
- Replaced `popAllScreensOnTapAnyTabs` with `keepNavigatorHistory`. The meaning (and default value) of this parameter is thus inverted. To migrate, flip the boolean value for that parameter if you use it.
- Combined `popAllScreensOnTapOfSelectedTab` and `popActionScreens` into the `SelectedTabPressConfig.popAction`.
  - Set `SelectedTabPressConfig.popAction` to `PopActionType.all` to pop all screens of the selected tab if it is pressed again
  - Set `SelectedTabPressConfig.popAction` to `PopActionType.single` to pop a single screen of the selected tab if it is pressed again
  - Set `SelectedTabPressConfig.popAction` to `PopActionType.none` to do nothing if it the selected tab pressed again
- Replaced `onSelectedTabPressWhenNoScreensPushed` with `SelectedTabPressConfig.onPressed`. The `onPressed` parameter informs you whether any pages are currently pushed to that tab.
- Removed `navBarHeight` parameter. Use the `height` parameter of each style instead if needed. `height` is not mandatory, so by default no specific height is set. Use `kBottomNavigationBarHeight` if you want the default previous behavior.

### Fixed

- PopScope now just blocks popping until the initial tab is selected and the child navigator cant be popped anymore

## [5.1.0] - 2024-03-28
### Fixed
- Fix deprecation of colorScheme.background
- The Main Scaffold only extends its body if necessary (full overlap or hidden navbar) to prevent unnecessary padding (equal to navbar height)
- Replace NavBar SlideTransition with SizeTransition to correctly report its size to the Main Scaffold
- Pass on the source padding to the Main Scaffold Body if the navbar is hidden
- Pass the source viewPadding if navbar is hidden and the new body padding of the Main Scaffold as a new viewPadding to the tabs to ensure better placement of FABs on individual screens
